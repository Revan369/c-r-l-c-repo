# c-r-l-c-repo
this repo is for the code refactor lesson challenge from edx it contains the html and css code for a marketing website that i have been asked to refactor.

html edited. i added alt attributes to three images with brief descriptions of the images updated readme with changes over all i used sematics in html to replace the divs and edited the css accordingly to account for these changes without coprimising the layout and function of the horiseon webpage. using html semantics helped to make everything more accessible
